# BAS Embedded Maps

Embeddable maps for visualising a feature on a suitable base map.

## Overview

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it is
of interest to others. Some resources, indicated with a 'üõ°' or 'üîí' symbol, can only be accessed by BAS staff or
project members respectively. Contact the [Project Maintainer](#project-maintainer) to request access.

This project provides a service applications can use to embed simple maps via an iframe of a single feature's geometry 
given by a query string parameter. 

These maps use a suitable basemap based on the feature geometry (i.e. Antarctic/Arctic/World/etc.) is used, with fixed 
and minimal map controls and feature symbology. 

Where a geometry is known to give a poor result (such as a bounding box covering Antarctica), a densified polygon will
be substituted automatically.

### Status

The initial version of this service:

- has very limited support for a fixed set of geometries only
- is intended for use in the [ADD Metadata Toolbox üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/add-metadata-toolbox) only

## Usage

For an Antarctic map:

```html
<iframe src="https://embedded-maps.data.bas.ac.uk/v1/?geom=%5B%5B%5B-180%2C%20-90%5D%2C%5B180%2C%20-90%5D%2C%5B180%2C%20-60%5D%2C%5B-180%2C%20-60%5D%2C%5B-180%2C%20-90%5D%5D%5D" style="border:none;"></iframe>
```

For a sub-Antarctic map:

```html
<iframe src="https://embedded-maps.data.bas.ac.uk/v1/?geom=geom=%5B%5B%5B-180%2C-60%5D%2C%5B180%2C-60%5D%2C%5B180%2C-50%5D%2C%5B-180%2C-50%5D%2C%5B-180%2C-60%5D%5D%5D" style="border:none;"></iframe>
```

**Note:** Requests for any other geometries will return a null response (grey square).

## Implementation

### App

A very simple placeholder app is used to parse the geometry query string value and use this to set the href of an 
`<img>` element. I.e. if the geom matches the [Well Known Extent](#well-known-extents) for Antarctica, the href to an 
image of map with the relevant extent shown is used.

`public/index.html` acts as the app entry point and template. `public/assets/js/main.js` contains all logic, including
locally defined [Well Known Extents](#well-known-extents).

### Basemaps

This service uses basemaps as determined by [MAGIC/esri#86 üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/esri/-/issues/86).

### Well Known Regions

Well Known Regions represent commonly referenced and understood areas of the world.

Supported regions are currently defined indirectly via their extents locally within `public/assets/js/main.js`.

### Well Known Extents

Well Known Extents represent commonly (if not officially) agreed upon bounding extents for 
[Well Known Regions](#well-known-extents). They consist of a bounding box expressed as a GeoJSON formatted geometry.

Supported extents are currently defined locally within `public/assets/js/main.js`.

## Setup

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://terraform.io) resources are defined in [`provisioning/terraform/`](/provisioning/terraform/).

Access to the [BAS AWS account üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/bas-aws) is required to provision these resources.
Docker and Docker Compose are recommended but not required for running Terraform.

```shell
$ cd provisioning/terraform
$ docker compose run terraform

$ terraform init
$ terraform ...
```

#### Terraform remote state

State information for this project is stored remotely using a
[Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html).

Specifically the [AWS S3](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) backend as part of the
[BAS Terraform Remote State üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/terraform-remote-state) project.

Remote state storage will be automatically initialised when running `terraform init`. Any changes to remote state will
be automatically saved to the remote backend, there is no need to push or pull changes.

##### Remote state authentication

Permission to read and/or write remote state information for this project is restricted to authorised users. Contact
the [BAS Web & Applications Team](mailto:servicedesk@bas.ac.uk) to request access.

See the [BAS Terraform Remote State üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/terraform-remote-state) project for how these
permissions to remote state are enforced.

## Developing

```
$ python -m http.server 9000 --directory public
```

## Testing

For local testing, with the app running locally run in a separate terminal:

```
$ python -m http.server 9001 --directory tests
```

For remote testing, manually visit:

- `$ENDPOINT/?geom=%5B%5B%5B-180%2C%20-90%5D%2C%5B180%2C%20-90%5D%2C%5B180%2C%20-60%5D%2C%5B-180%2C%20-60%5D%2C%5B-180%2C%20-90%5D%5D%5D` (Antarctica)
- `$ENDPOINT/?geom=%5B%5B%5B-180%2C-60%5D%2C%5B180%2C-60%5D%2C%5B180%2C-50%5D%2C%5B-180%2C-50%5D%2C%5B-180%2C-60%5D%5D%5D` (Sub Antarctica)

Where `$ENDPOINT` is:

- `https://embedded-maps-testing.bas.ac.uk/v1/` (integration)
- `https://embedded-maps.bas.ac.uk/v1/` (integration)

These URLs should return an expected map of each of these [Well Known Regions](#well-known-regions) based on their 
[Well Known Extents](#well-known-extents).

### Health monitoring

`$ENDPOINT/meta/health.json` provides service health information formatted according to the 
[api-health-check](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/) specification. This endpoint should be used to monitor
the health of this service.

## Deployment

The application will be automatically deployed to S3 using [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment).

### Continuous Deployment

A Continuous Deployment process using GitLab's CI/CD platform is configured in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](/.gitlab-ci.yml).
