# BAS Embedded Maps Service

Simple embeddable maps for visualising a feature on a suitable basemap.

## Overview

**Note:** This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case it is
of interest to others. Some resources, indicated with a 'üõ°' or 'üîí' symbol, can only be accessed by BAS staff or
project members respectively. Contact the [Project Maintainer](#project-maintainer) to request access.

This project provides a service for applications to embed simple maps of the Polar Regions.
- maps are embedded via an iframe and the display of features is controlled by query parameters
- maps use a basemap based on the feature geometry (i.e. if in the Antarctic, an Antarctic basemap)
- maps use fixed and minimal map controls and feature symbology

### Status
The initial version of this service is intended for use in the [ADD Metadata Toolbox üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/add-metadata-toolbox) only

## Usage
The service supports four map projections that are automatically selected based on the provided geometry:

- Antarctic projection (latitude ‚â§ -60¬∞)
- Arctic projection (latitude ‚â• 60¬∞)
- World projection (latitudes between -60¬∞ and 60¬∞)
- South Georgia projection (latitude between -55.200717 and -53.641972 and longitude between -38.643677 and -35.271423)

Maps can be configured using the following query parameters:

**View Configuration:**
- `center`: Initial center coordinates [longitude, latitude] `array[number, number]`
- `zoom`: Initial zoom level `number`
- `scale`: Initial scale level `number`
- `bbox`: Bounding box coordinates [minX, minY, maxX, maxY] `array[number, number, number, number]`
- `show-region`: Whether to zoom to the basemap region `boolean`

**Asset Display:**
- `asset-id`: Asset ID to display on the map `string`
- `show-asset-popup`: Whether to show the asset popup `boolean`

**UI Controls:**
- `globe-overview`: Whether to show a globe overview `boolean`
- `hide-ui`: Whether to hide the map controls `boolean`
- `show-full-screen`: Whether to enable fullscreen mode `boolean`

For an Antarctic map:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://embedded-maps.data.bas.ac.uk/v1/?center=[-180, -90]&zoom=6&globe_overview=true" 
  style="border:none;"
  allowfullscreen="true"
  allow="fullscreen">
</iframe>
```

**Note:** To enable fullscreen functionality, the `allowfullscreen` and `allow="fullscreen"` attributes must be added to the iframe element.

## Implementation

### App

The application is built using React and the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. Key features include:

- Automatic projection selection based on geometry location
- Support for different basemaps optimized for Antarctic, Arctic, and World views
- Built-in map controls (zoom, home)
- Optional globe overview
- Loading states and error handling

### Basemaps

This service uses basemaps as determined by [MAGIC/esri#86 üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/esri/-/issues/86).

Each projection comes with an optimized basemap and view configuration for the best visualization of features in that region.

## Setup

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://terraform.io) resources are defined in [`provisioning/terraform/`](/provisioning/terraform/).

Access to the [BAS AWS account üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/bas-aws) is required to provision these resources.
Docker and Docker Compose are recommended but not required for running Terraform.

```shell
$ cd provisioning/terraform
$ docker compose run terraform

$ terraform init
$ terraform ...
```

#### Terraform remote state

State information for this project is stored remotely using a
[Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html).

Specifically the [AWS S3](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) backend as part of the
[BAS Terraform Remote State üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/terraform-remote-state) project.

Remote state storage will be automatically initialised when running `terraform init`. Any changes to remote state will
be automatically saved to the remote backend, there is no need to push or pull changes.

##### Remote state authentication

Permission to read and/or write remote state information for this project is restricted to authorised users. Contact
the [BAS Web & Applications Team](mailto:servicedesk@bas.ac.uk) to request access.

See the [BAS Terraform Remote State üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/WSF/terraform-remote-state) project for how these
permissions to remote state are enforced.

## Developing

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** Node.js is required to run the project.

### Health monitoring

`$ENDPOINT/meta/health.json` provides service health information formatted according to the 
[api-health-check](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/) specification. This endpoint should be used to monitor
the health of this service.

## Deployment

The application will be automatically deployed to S3 using [Continuous Deployment](#continuous-deployment).

### Continuous Deployment

A Continuous Deployment process using GitLab's CI/CD platform is configured in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](/.gitlab-ci.yml).
